# Java Core to OOPS Concepts with Practical Examples

Welcome to the Java Core to OOPS Concepts repository! Here you'll find a collection of Java programs designed to help you learn Java from the fundamentals to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Each code file is accompanied by detailed explanations and comments to aid your understanding.

## Contents

This repository contains approximately 55-60 Java programs covering various topics, including:

- Variables and Data Types
- Control Flow (if-else, switch)
- Loops (for, while, do-while)
- Arrays and Collections
- Methods and Functions
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts:
  - Classes and Objects
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
  - Encapsulation
  - Abstraction
- Exception Handling
- File Handling
- And more!

## Getting Started

To start learning, simply navigate to the directory and explore the Java files. Each file is self-contained and focuses on a specific topic. You can read through the comments within the code to understand the concepts and run the programs to see them in action.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Open any Java file in your preferred IDE or text editor.
3. Read through the comments to understand the code.
4. Compile and run the Java file to see the program output.
5. Experiment with the code by making changes and observing the results.
